# Utilities
From time to time, I need to test new system's communications.
For that, I needed a set of utilities that just worked.

## Network
In this repo, there is simple network sample code for
 - Multicast
 - UDP
 - TCP
 - Serial

## Serial
There is also simple sample code for serial utilities, originally intended for the many UARTs on the RPi 4.
